Title: Development & Contributing

This page describes how to set up a local development environment, run tests, and understand the CI gates for Typus.

Environment

- Python 3.10+ (CI runs on 3.10, 3.11, 3.12)
- Use `uv` and Makefile shortcuts (no plain `pip` in scripts/CI):

```
make dev-setup      # creates .venv (py310) and installs -e .[dev,sqlite]
make dev-install    # installs pre-commit hooks
```

Formatting & Lint

```
make format         # uv run ruff format .
make lint           # uv run ruff check --fix .
```

Tests

Lightweight SQLite-backed tests (default for local dev and CI):

```
make ci
```

Full test suite (SQLite + any guarded tests that donâ€™t require Postgres):

```
make test
```

Postgres-backed tests (optional, requires a running DB):

```
export TYPUS_TEST_DSN=postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:ooglyboogly69@localhost:5432/ibrida-v0
export POSTGRES_DSN=$TYPUS_TEST_DSN
export ELEVATION_DSN=$TYPUS_TEST_DSN
export ELEVATION_TABLE=elevation_raster

# Name search / PG subset (dataset-dependent)
make test-pg

# Elevation smoke tests (guarded; requires raster table)
TYPUS_ELEVATION_TEST=1 uv run pytest -q -k elevation_service

Important: avoid exporting `POSTGRES_DSN` when running the full suite unless
you intend to run against the live database. Some tests (e.g. children/depth)
assert counts that are specific to the SQLite sample fixture and will not match
the full production dataset. The recommended workflow is:

1) Run `make ci` / `make test` without `POSTGRES_DSN` to exercise SQLite.
2) Run `make test-pg` for Postgres-specific coverage (name search, etc.).
```

Notes:

- Ensure the Postgres database contains the required `expanded_taxa` table with the
  recommended indexes. You can bootstrap indexes with:

```
uv run typus-pg-ensure-indexes
```

Pre-commit

```
make dev-install
```

Hooks run on commit and in CI:
- ruff (lint)
- ruff-format (check-only in CI)
- whitespace/yaml fixers
- pytest-lite (fast subset; mirrors `make ci` test selection)

JSON Schemas

If you add or change public Pydantic models, append the dotted path to
`typus/export_schemas.py` and regenerate schemas:

```
uv run python -m typus.export_schemas
```

Generated JSON files live under `typus/schemas/` and are committed to the repo.
Currently, schema export is a manual step (not enforced by CI).

Perf Harness (optional)

```
make perf
```

Writes a report to `dev/agents/perf_report.md`. You can enable `TYPUS_PERF_VERIFY=1` for strict checks,
and `TYPUS_PERF_EXPLAIN=1` to append EXPLAIN snippets for Postgres.

Service Backends

- SQLite: for offline/dev; loader creates indexes by default.
- Postgres: for production or full datasets; `typus-pg-ensure-indexes` adds recommended indexes.
- Elevation: Postgres-only; use `ELEVATION_DSN` and `ELEVATION_TABLE` (default `elevation_raster`).

CI/CD Overview

- CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):
  - Matrix on Python 3.10/3.11/3.12.
  - Runs pre-commit (ruff, ruff-format, whitespace, pytest-lite) with `--show-diff-on-failure`.
  - Then runs `ruff format --check` and `ruff check`.
  - Runs a lightweight SQLite-backed pytest selection.
- Publish workflow (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`):
  - Blocks build/publish on tests job.
  - Builds and uploads wheels, then deploys docs on tag.
